# This requires a volume pointing to /scl has previously been mounted.
# In minikube you can do that by doing (at the root folder of this repository):
minikube mount .:/scl

# There is a bug in minikube and sometimes it may fail to load the volume:
# https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/12729
# To fix that run
minikube ip

# Then run the mount command but with the additional ip parameter (replace the last value of the ip for 1)
minikube mount .:/scl --ip 192.168.205.1

# To verify the volume was successfully mounted do this (you should see the contents of this repo there):
minikube ssh
ls /scl

# To validate this Helm Chart
helm install --dry-run --debug -f ./values.yaml mecc .

# To install
helm install -f ./values.yaml mecc .
